# boulder: A self-hostable credentials manager web service.

Do you have NIH syndrome? Me too, which is why I made this web service so I can stop paying Â£2.99 a month for 1Password.

## How Boulder works
There are several moving parts to Boulder:
- A web server that has can be unlocked and locked as required
- A command-line interface that serves as the current primary way to interact with a Boulder server
- The core (which holds methods for storing data, encryption and decryption, and other misc things)

## Deployment
Currently boulder only supports deployment through Shuttle, but Dockerfile deployments should be getting added shortly.

## Features
- Seal/unseal and timed unseal feature
	- The web service initially starts out as locked and cannot be accessed unless you unseal it by using the master key given to you when you first create the web service.
- Basic IAM system
	- Create users and assign them roles. Lock credential usability either by role or by username.
	- Users can only grab credentials by either using the API with the custom header or the CLI, and must log in through the CLI first to be able to get a key.
- Entirely self sufficient - no database required!
	- An in-memory database is currently implemented but a file storage implementation is on the roadmap, because nobody hates themselves enough to use a fully in-memory only implementation of a credentials manager... right? Right.
	- However, Postgres is aimed to be supported because everyone and their mom can get one these days and they are pretty cheap. Plus, persistent external storage is pretty good.
